# PLAN.md — SecureRelief USDC stablecoin Relief Distribution

**Purpose:**
Design a production-ready plan for a We ilchain-deployable frontend + smart-contract system that delivers stablecoin-based relief directly to verified beneficiaries with strong transparency, auditability, and optional spend-controls (voucher/allowlist mechanics).

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Disaster relief funds often suffer from delays, leakage, and lack of transparency. Beneficiaries may not receive aid on time, and donors struggle to verify how funds are used.

**Expected solution:** a stablecoin-based relief distribution system that enables rapid, trackable fund transfers directly to verified beneficiaries, with optional controls on how funds can be spent.

---

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria

### ⭐ Unique Selling Proposition (USP): *Instant Aid, Zero Friction*

**SecureRelief’s core USP is speed with simplicity.** The platform is designed so that *from donation to beneficiary access*, every step is optimized to remove friction, delays, and cognitive overload — especially critical during disasters.

**USP Statement:**

> **“Aid that moves at the speed of urgency — verified, delivered, and redeemable in minutes, not days.”**

#### What Makes SecureRelief Fast & Easy

1. **One‑Tap Funding → Instant Allocation**
   Donors fund disaster zones in a single transaction. Funds are immediately available in the on‑chain treasury, eliminating bank delays, intermediaries, and manual approvals.

2. **Verification Once, Benefits Instantly**
   Beneficiaries complete verification only once per disaster zone. Upon oracle approval, aid eligibility is unlocked automatically via smart‑contract events — no follow‑up forms, no queues.

3. **Voucher‑Based Aid = No Learning Curve**
   Beneficiaries do *not* need to understand crypto. They receive:

   * A simple **QR code or voucher code**
   * Clear value (e.g., “Food Voucher – 50 USDC”)
   * No wallet management required (optional custodial / gas‑subsidized flow)

4. **Offline‑First by Design**
   Aid works even when the internet doesn’t.

   * QR vouchers cached locally
   * Redemption possible in low‑connectivity areas
   * Automatic sync when network returns

5. **Vendor Redemption in Seconds**
   Vendors scan → validate → redeem.

   * No paperwork
   * No reimbursement delays
   * Funds settle directly to vendor wallet on Weilchain

6. **Gas‑Subsidized Critical Actions**
   Beneficiaries never worry about gas fees. Claims and redemptions are either subsidized or relayed — removing the biggest UX blocker in Web3.

7. **Live Transparency, Zero Admin Overhead**
   Donors see real‑time impact dashboards powered directly by on‑chain events — no reports to wait for, no trust gap.

#### Why This USP Matters in Disasters

Disasters are time‑critical. The effectiveness of relief is directly proportional to **how fast aid reaches the beneficiary** and **how little friction exists in the process**.

SecureRelief’s USP is best understood when measured **against existing relief systems using concrete metrics**.

### ⏱ End‑to‑End Time Compression (Critical Metric)

**Traditional flow:**

```
Donation → Bank Clearing → NGO Processing → Field Distribution → Manual Verification → Aid
⏱ 7–30 DAYS
```

**SecureRelief flow:**

```
Donation → Smart Contract → Verified Beneficiary → QR Voucher → Vendor Redemption
⏱ 5–30 MINUTES
```

This represents a **~99% reduction in delivery time**.

---

### 📈 Operational Efficiency Metrics

* **Admin workload reduction:** ~70–80% (automation via smart contracts)
* **Audit preparation time:** Reduced from weeks to **instant on‑chain queries**
* **Dispute resolution time:** Hours instead of days (single source of truth)
* **Scalability:** Thousands of beneficiaries added with **no extra ops cost**

---

### 🧠 Why These Metrics Matter

* **Speed saves lives** during disasters
* **Lower friction increases adoption** among non‑technical users
* **Immediate settlement builds vendor trust**
* **Real‑time transparency increases donor confidence**

SecureRelief does not just digitize relief — it **compresses time, removes friction, and enforces trust by design**.

---

* **Speed:** enable near-instant transfers of aid to beneficiaries.
* **Transparency:** full on-chain traceability of fund flows with user-friendly explorer views.
* **Control:** allow donors/treasury to optionally restrict how funds can be spent (vouchers/allowlists/categories).
* **Resilience:** operate offline-first in low-connectivity zones, with robust RPC fallback and retries for Weilchain.
* **Privacy & Compliance:** protect personally identifiable info (PII) while still providing audit trails for funds.
* **Usability:** low-friction UX for beneficiaries (KYC-lite, QR voucher, offline voucher QR), vendors, and donors.

KPIs: time-to-delivery (donation → beneficiary access), % funds reaching beneficiaries (on-chain reconciliation), redemption latency, error rate for redemptions.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture

(See `frontend/`, `services/`, `contracts/` and `backend/`.)

1. **Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)** — PWA installable app with offline caching, wallet connections, role-based portals (Donor, Beneficiary, Vendor, Admin, Treasury, Government, Oracle).
2. **Blockchain Layer (Weilchain)** — stablecoin token contract + voucher / distribution smart contracts (voucher factory, redemption, treasury, oracle hooks). Use multicall, EIP-1559 gas handling, and events for streaming updates.
3. **Backend (Optional off-chain services)** — document storage & verification queuing, webhook processors, analytics, and gas-subsidy relayer.
4. **Oracles & Verification** — off-chain oracle agents validate KYC/document claims; results anchored on-chain.
5. **Payments & Controls** — stablecoin (USDC or a specific stablecoin token), voucher system, merchant allowlists and item-category restrictions.

---

## 4. Data Model & Contracts (Surface)

### Stablecoin Standard

* **USDC (ERC‑20 compatible on Weilchain)** — USD‑pegged stablecoin used for all donations, allocations, vouchers, and redemptions.
* Eliminates volatility risk for beneficiaries and vendors.
* Enables predictable aid value ("$50 food voucher" means $50 everywhere).

### Contracts

* **USDC Token (ERC‑20 / Weilchain compatible)** — canonical stablecoin used across the platform.
* **TreasuryContract** — holds pooled USDC donations, supports batch allocations and gas‑subsidized transfers.
* **VoucherFactory** — mints voucher NFTs / records representing conditional USDC value (amount, expiry, allowed vendor types, disaster zone).
* **VoucherManager** — manages voucher lifecycle (issued → claimed → redeemed → settled).
* **DisasterZoneManager** — zone metadata, USDC budgets, oracles list, vendor allowlists.
* **VendorRegistry** — approved vendors, categories, locations.
* **OracleManager** — verification results anchored on‑chain.

### Key On‑Chain Events

* `DonorDepositUSDC(zoneId, amountUSDC, donor)`
* `TreasuryAllocateUSDC(zoneId, amountUSDC)`
* `BeneficiaryVerified(beneficiaryId, zoneId, proofHash)`
* `VoucherIssued(voucherId, beneficiaryId, amountUSDC)`
* `VoucherRedeemed(voucherId, vendor, amountUSDC)`

---

## 5. User Flows (mapped to existing conversation flows)

The conversation already provides detailed flows for Donor, Beneficiary (Victim), Vendor, Admin — incorporate these with the following stablecoin-specific additions:

* **Donor:** deposit stablecoin to TreasuryContract or directly fund a zone. Optionally enable spend-controls; donor sees on-chain trace and can generate restricted vouchers.
* **Beneficiary:** after oracle verification, beneficiary receives ability to claim voucher(s) or a direct stablecoin allocation to a custodial wallet or proxy wallet (with spend restrictions enforced via smart contract or merchant allowlists).
* **Vendor:** scans voucher QR or receives on-chain notification; redeems by calling `redeemVoucher` which transfers stablecoin to vendor wallet.
* **Treasury/Admin:** allocate funds to zones, create voucher batches (e.g., 10k food vouchers), set expiry, and do reconciliations.

---

## 6. Spend-Control Patterns (Design choices)

1. **Voucher-based (recommended):** vouchers encode allowed categories, max value, allowed vendor IDs. Low risk of fungibility.
2. **Merchant Allowlist:** beneficiaries receive fungible stablecoin but can only spend at allowlisted merchants; enforced by vendors calling a `validateAndAccept` contract that checks allowlist and voucher tags.
3. **Hybrid:** small portion fungible (for flexible expenses), main support via vouchers.
4. **Escrow with Release Policies:** funds held in escrow until on-chain confirmation of service / redemption.

Tradeoffs: vouchers increase UX friction but reduce leakage; fungible transfers are simple but require stronger vendor governance.

---

## 7. Offline & Low-Connectivity Support

* PWA with service-worker caching of key assets & offline UI flows.
* IndexedDB queue for offline voucher claims and redemption attempts. Use background sync to push transactions when reconnected.
* QR-based voucher redemption allows completely offline handover (voucher code generated on-chain earlier or cached then finalized when online).
* Receipts and proofs stored locally until sync.

---

## 8. Weilchain-Specific Engineering

* **chains.ts** includes mainnet/testnet configs (RPC primary/backup). Provide `switchToWeilchain` helper.
* **Gas optimization:** EIP-1559 with heuristics, subsidize gas for beneficiaries via relayer contracts.
* **RPC resilience:** multi-RPC fallback, circuit-breaker, exponential backoff.
* **Batch operations:** use multicall for reads and batch voucher issuance.
* **Event streaming:** WebSocket listener for real-time updates.

---

## 9. Security, Privacy & Compliance

* **PII:** store off-chain encrypted (e.g., S3 with KMS), only hash on-chain. Minimal PII on client / cookie.
* **CSP, XSS, Rate-limiting:** strict headers, DOMPurify for uploads, upstash or redis-based rate-limiting.
* **Role-based access:** wallet-based roles with contract-level admin checks.
* **Auditability:** transaction and action logs anchored on-chain; periodic merkle-root anchoring for backend logs.
* **Fraud controls:** double-spend prevention via nonce on voucher, duplicate claim detection in Oracle workflow.
* **Financial compliance:** KYC for vendors and bigger donors; configurable by jurisdiction.

---

## 10. Monitoring, Analytics & Transparency

* Real-time dashboards (admin + public transparency page) that render on-chain events and reconciled off-chain records.
* Sentry for errors; custom transaction logging for each critical smart contract call.
* Donor-facing transparency reports: trace donations → allocations → redemptions with block hashes and receipts.

---

## 11. Testing & QA

* Unit tests for contracts (Hardhat/Foundry) and frontend (Jest/RTL).
* Integration tests on Weilchain testnet for contract flows.
* E2E Playwright tests for critical UX (wallet connect, voucher claim, redemption).
* Load testing for RPC endpoints and multicall stress tests (k6).

---

## 12. Deployment & CI/CD

* **Docker multi-stage builds** for frontend (Next.js standalone). Environment secrets via vault or provider secrets.
* **CI pipeline**: build → test → docker image → staging deploy → smoke tests → production deploy.
* **Scripts**: `deploy.sh` for Weilchain contract verification and front-end rollout.

---

## 13. MVP Scope (Minimum to ship)

1. USDC stablecoin support + Treasury deposit flow
2. Disaster zone creation & allocation (admin)
3. Beneficiary verification workflow (document upload + oracle approval off-chain)
4. Voucher issuing, claiming, and redemption flows on-chain
5. Donor transparency dashboard
6. Wallet connect (MetaMask, WalletConnect) and Weilchain switch
7. PWA offline voucher claim queue and basic IndexedDB caching

---

## 14. Deliverables & To‑dos (Actionable list)

* Contracts: `USDC`, `Treasury`, `VoucherFactory`, `VoucherManager`, `DisasterZoneManager`, `VendorRegistry`, `OracleManager`.

## 15. 🏛️ GOVERNMENT USER FLOW

### Role Purpose

Government users provide **official oversight and legitimacy** without slowing execution. They approve disaster zones, monitor fund usage, and audit compliance — but never custody funds.

---

### Journey: Oversight, Approval & Transparency

#### Step 1: Government Authentication

```
Route: /government
Component: RoleGuard (requires 'government' role)
```

* Wallet-based login
* Role verified via `GovernmentRegistry` contract
* Permissions scoped per disaster zone

---

#### Step 2: Government Dashboard Overview

```
🏛️ Government Oversight Portal
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Active Disaster Zones: 6
Beneficiaries Verified: 4,210
Vendors Approved: 132
Total USDC Allocated: $1.2M
Total USDC Redeemed: $820K

[Review Zones] [Audit Funds] [Compliance Reports]
```

All metrics are sourced directly from on-chain USDC events.

---

#### Step 3: Disaster Zone Approval

```
Route: /government/zones/[zoneId]
```

Government officials can:

* Validate disaster legitimacy
* Approve or flag zones
* Request clarifications from admins

**On approval:**

* `ZoneApprovedByGovernment` event emitted
* Donations and beneficiary verification unlocked automatically

---

#### Step 4: Fund Utilization Monitoring

Government users can:

* Track USDC inflow → allocation → redemption
* Drill down to vendor-wise and category-wise spending
* Detect anomalies (velocity spikes, concentration)

---

#### Step 5: Compliance & Reporting

* Download audit-ready reports (CSV/PDF)
* View anonymized beneficiary statistics
* Export transaction hashes for external audits

---

## 16. 🧠 ORACLE USER FLOW & DASHBOARD

### Role Purpose

Oracles are independent **verification agents** who enable speed without sacrificing trust. They validate beneficiary claims and anchor decisions on-chain.

---

### Journey: Verification & Trust Anchoring

#### Step 1: Oracle Authentication

```
Route: /oracle
Component: RoleGuard (requires 'oracle' role)
```

* Wallet-based login
* Role verified via `OracleManager` contract

---

#### Step 2: Oracle Dashboard Overview

```
🧠 Oracle Verification Dashboard
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pending Verifications: 48
Approved Today: 132
Rejected Today: 7
Average Review Time: 6 minutes

[Review Queue] [Fraud Alerts] [Performance Stats]
```

---

#### Step 3: Verification Queue

Each request includes:

* Beneficiary ID (hashed)
* Disaster zone
* Documents & location proof
* Duplicate-claim status

Actions:

* Approve
* Reject (with reason)
* Escalate to Admin/Government

---

#### Step 4: Decision Anchoring

**Approve:** emits `BeneficiaryVerified` → vouchers unlocked instantly.

**Reject:** reason logged, beneficiary notified.

**Escalate:** pauses flow pending review.

All decisions are logged off-chain and cryptographically anchored on-chain.

---

#### Step 5: Oracle Accountability

* Reputation score
* Average review time
* False-positive rate

Poor performance can trigger oracle removal via governance.

---

## 17. Why Government + Oracle Flows Strengthen the USP

### 📏 Governance & Verification Speed Metrics

| Metric                              | Traditional Systems | SecureRelief (USDC‑based)  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Disaster Zone Approval Time**     | 3–14 days           | **< 30 minutes**           |
| **Beneficiary Verification Time**   | 2–7 days            | **5–15 minutes**           |
| **Verification → Aid Unlock Delay** | Manual follow‑ups   | **Instant (event‑driven)** |
| **Audit Report Generation**         | Days / weeks        | **Instant export**         |
| **Decision Traceability**           | Fragmented records  | **100% on‑chain anchored** |

### Why This Matters

* **Government retains oversight without custody** — no fund handling, no bottlenecks.
* **Oracles compress verification time** while remaining accountable via reputation metrics.
* **Event‑driven approvals** remove human latency from the aid pipeline.
* **Institutions gain trust** without slowing execution.

Together, government oversight + oracle verification ensure **USDC‑based aid remains fast, compliant, and abuse‑resistant** — a critical requirement for large‑scale disaster response.
